<p>I was born on the west coast of Sweden and lived there most of my life. I then moved to New York to pursue dance at a dance school in Manhattan 6 years ago until I decided to go to College and here I am. I have a weird obsession for dogs and kombucha.</p>



<p>Food, family and friends is my life</p>
